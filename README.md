# Flowplayer / Advanced Demos

These demos are advanced demos too complex for codepen to accurately respresent and allow developers to tinker with.

To explore a demo:

```bash
cd demos/<demo> && npm install && npm start
```

After that you should be able to checkout the app running at `localhost:1234`
